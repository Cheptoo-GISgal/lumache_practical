**System for Earth Observation Data Access, Processing and Analysis for Land Monitoring (SEPAL)**
=================================================================================================

**System for Earth Observation Data Access, Processing and Analysis for Land Monitoring (SEPAL)** is part of the `Open Foris <https://openforis.org/>`_ Suite of Tools. The platform allows users to query and process satellite data quickly and efficiently, tailor their products for local needs, and produce sophisticated and relevant geospatial analyses. Harnessing cloud-based supercomputers and modern geospatial data infrastructures (e.g. GEE), the interface enables access and processing of historical satellite data as well as newer data from Landsat and higher-resolution data from Europe’s Copernicus program.

SEPAL is a cloud computing-based platform for autonomous land monitoring using remotely sensed data. It is a combination of GEE and open-source software such as:

+ GDAL

+ Jupyter

+ the Open Foris Geospatial Toolkit

+ ORFEO Toolbox 

+ Python

R, R Shiny Server, R Studio Server, and SNAP Toolkit. The platform allows users to access powerful cloud-computing 
resources to query, access and process satellite data quickly and efficiently for creating advanced analyses.

.. note:: This is a note admonition.
   This is the second line of the first paragraph.



  Simply put:SEPAL empowers people around the world to gain a better understanding of land cover dynamics by facilitating
  the efficient access and use of Earth observation data – without the need of coding knowledge!
