**System for Earth Observation Data Access, Processing and Analysis for Land Monitoring (SEPAL)**
=================================================================================================

**System for Earth Observation Data Access, Processing and Analysis for Land Monitoring (SEPAL)** is part of the `Open Foris <https://openforis.org/>`_ Suite of Tools. The platform allows users to query and process satellite data quickly and efficiently, tailor their products for local needs, and produce sophisticated and relevant geospatial analyses. Harnessing cloud-based supercomputers and modern geospatial data infrastructures (e.g. GEE), the interface enables access and processing of historical satellite data as well as newer data from Landsat and higher-resolution data from Europeâ€™s Copernicus program.

SEPAL is a cloud computing-based platform for autonomous land monitoring using remotely sensed data. It is a combination of GEE and open-source software such as:

+ GDAL

+ Jupyter

+ the Open Foris Geospatial Toolkit

+ ORFEO Toolbox 

+ Python

R, R Shiny Server, R Studio Server, and SNAP Toolkit. The platform allows users to access powerful cloud-computing 
resources to query, access and process satellite data quickly and efficiently for creating advanced analyses.

.. topic:: Formatting block elements

  A topic is like a block quote with a title, or a self-contained section with no subsections. Use the "topic" directive to        indicate a self-contained idea that is separate from the flow of the document. Topics may occur anywhere a section or             transition may occur. Body elements and topics may not contain nested topics.The directive's sole argument is interpreted as the  topic title; the next line must be blank. All subsequent lines make up the topic body, interpreted as body elements.
